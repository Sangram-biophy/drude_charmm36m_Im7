# Comparative analysis of Im7 dynamics with polarizable and non-polarizable CHARMM family of force fields
This repository contains input files for simulation of Im7 protein with CHARMM36m and DRUDE2019 force field along with the analysis scripts for comparing the protein dynamics, salt bridge dynamics and cation-protein interactions between the CHARMM36m and DRUDE2019 force fields.
